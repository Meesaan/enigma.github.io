Hello there...

Welcome to machine learning magazine. Here we will learn and discuss how machine learning is used in several key fields and industries. For example, in the healthcare industry, data scientist use machine learning to test if a tumor is at risk of developing into cancer is either benign or malignant.

Financial analysts can also use machine learning to make decisions about customers loan applications and customer segmentation for example I would also show you how websites such as amazon or netflix create recommendation systems to their customers about their various products or services such as which books to buy or what movies to see based on their previous selection.  

 Let us assume that we have a human cell sample extracted from a patient with certain characteristics such as; uniformity of cell, cell shape and clump thickness or size etc. One question we may want to ask at this point is; is this a benign or malignant cell? But of course, only a doctor can review said cell to give a proper diagnosis.
