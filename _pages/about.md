Hey there, welcome to my blog/portfolio, my name is Misan. I a Masters degree (Adv. Computer Science) holder from University of Liverpool. I have worked extensively with different categories of data over the past 3 years and as such, have developed experience as a data scientist in python. This is the most exciting project I have ever been involved with because it is quite frankly very easy to fall in love with. If or when you do decide to take this ride with me to explore 'data', you would come to see why it is one of the most talked about branch of computer science.
While I would be going through several use cases and examples, I would lay emphases on some focal points such as;

DATA IMPORTATION from a variety of sources such as; flat files, web scraping and APIs.

DATA CLEANING, MANIPULATION and EDA (visual and statistical) with Pandas.

DATA VISUALIZATION with matplotlib, Seaborn and Bokeh.

DATA MODELING with SKlearn such as; Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision trees, Random Forests, Ensemble methods, Naive Bayes, K_Means, and PCA.

DEEP LEARNING and artificial neural networks & convolutional neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow.

Natural language processing.

When I am not working, I enjoy reading just about anything as long as its new, I like taking long walks while listening to alternative rock songs and I enjoy having lovely time out with friends and loved ones.
